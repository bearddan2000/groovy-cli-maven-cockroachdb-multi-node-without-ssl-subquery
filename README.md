## Description
Creates a small database table
called `dog`. This table, `dog`, has been normalized to 3NF.
Two new tables have been added, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`.
Creates a new table `dog_expanded` that joins

implicit index on `dog_expanded`.id. Using a subquery with the aggregate function COUNT, create a new view `breed_count`.
